# 👊️ *SHE WANTS YOU* 👊️

## Collaborate with us 👫️

Shenanigan takes pride in maintaining open source code and encouraging community engagement. 
Not only will open source garner higher trust factor, we believe in the community as builders. Bloggers, developers, social media unicorns, and the rest of you see all valued here. 

## Where to look 🔎️

The first step you should take to collaborate is joining the [Discord](http://www.she.energy/join). 

Our discord is where we communicate our ideas, hold discussions, and make friends so introduce yourself, onboard your accounts into our cred system, and then read the rest of this doc.

We love to hear your comments and feedback so feel free to share. We promise to give honest opinions only.



## Roles
Shenanigan is decentralized and open source so we don't organize under a hierarchy. Join a collective of individual buidlers and entrepreneurs.

### Designers 🎨️

Designers are coveted in the crypto-space. Nothing makes a project cooler than great visual design. Whether you make art or memes. Try your best to align with Shenanigan's futuristic, techno-punk arcade style.

We like to say that we are building an 80's arcade in the year 2050 😁.

  * Check our design doc *(coming soon)*
  * Ask the @team in the discord for pointers.
  * Check out our [colony](http://colony.io/shenanigan) for open bounties. Usually we give DAI rewards for projects.
